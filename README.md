### Introduction

This is a rock, paper, scissors emulator writtin in javascript in fulfillment of the Web Development 101 Javascript unit. It employs several of the concepts that were introduced in the unit such as proper syntax, functions, booleans, conditionals, variables, and others. I'm still learning so my code may be rudimentary; however, I intend to revisit this as an opportunity to practice as I learn more.
